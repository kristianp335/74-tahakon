A simple Liferay theme that allows for easy customization of the color scheme using Style Books.

The theme also has an override of Liferay Clay based on the popular Bootstrap Creative theme. 

The Minium B2B demo theme has also been imported to this theme and modified. Thank to Martin for the bug fix.

### Set Up

1. `npm install`
2. `gulp build`
3. `Deploy it your Liferay instance and cross your fingers`
4. `Modify it to your satisfaction`

Thanks to Evan from Liferay and his fabulous work.
